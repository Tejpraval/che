    <h4>Water availability of each state in India</h4>
    <p>As of now, I don't have the exact percentage of total water availability for each state in India. However, I can provide some general information about water availability in India.<br/>

        India's water availability varies significantly by region and is influenced by factors such as rainfall, surface water sources, and groundwater reserves. The states with higher annual rainfall and abundant river sources tend to have greater water availability compared to those with arid or semi-arid climates.<br/>
        
        Some of the states with higher water availability due to significant river networks and annual rainfall include Assam, West Bengal, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, and Madhya Pradesh. States in central and southern India such as Rajasthan, Gujarat, Maharashtra, and Karnataka often face water scarcity due to lower rainfall and limited surface water sources.<br/>
        
        For specific and up-to-date percentages of water availability for each state in India, I recommend consulting official reports from the Central Water Commission or the Ministry of Jal Shakti. These sources can provide detailed statistics and analysis of water availability by state.<br/>
        
        If you require more in-depth information about a particular state or want to know more about water management in India, feel free to ask and I'll be happy to assist further.  </p>
    <h4>Summary</h4>
    <p>The availability of water in India varies significantly by region and is influenced by factors such as rainfall, surface water sources, and groundwater reserves. States with higher annual rainfall and abundant river networks tend to have greater water availability, while those with arid or semi-arid climates often face water scarcity. Detailed percentages of water availability for each state can be obtained from official reports from the Central Water Commission or the Ministry of Jal Shakti, which provide comprehensive statistics and analysis. Addressing issues related to water availability requires a combination of sustainable management practices, efficient use of water resources, and ongoing monitoring and conservation efforts.  </p>
